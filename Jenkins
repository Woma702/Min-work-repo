Thanks for the opportunity to interview with you. 
I have worked extensively as a cloud engineer and DevOps engineer where I have mostly gained experience with AWS  
services, ranging from IAM, VPC, Subnets, VPC ENDPOINT, Transit gateway, Direct Connect,S3, RDS, ALB   
I am also familiar with configuration management tools like ansible which is an open-source tool and systems manager which is an AWS  
native tool. 
 
For cloud orchestration and automation, Iâ€™ve use infrastructure as code tools such as terraform which is cloud-agnostic, and  
CloudFormation to build different infrastructure in different environments.  
I have used Jenkins and integrated GitHub to set up an environment for different environments.t 
 I did the initial set up of Jenkins including installing all the plugins and connecting it to GitHub.   
 
I configured a webhook in the repository to be used by developers to push their application codes. 
As such, every time a code is pushed to that repository, it triggers the Jenkins pipeline to automatically check the code, test, build and deploy the artifact.  
In this project I used Maven to build the artifact, SonarQube to check the artifact for any bugs or vulnerabilities, Nexus to version control the artifact and ansible to deploy to the respective environments. 
I have built, deployed and maintained Kubernetes clusters using EKS. I have  monitored my Kubernetes cluster using Prometheus and Grafana,  ensuring all the nodes are healthy. 
This is a high level of my experience 
 
Contract is coming to an end and there is no current project
